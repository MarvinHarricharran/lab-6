Articles:
An article titled "Turning Delayed/Deferred Aircraft Maintenance into Timely Resolutions" examines the underlying reasons behind airline terminology used to defer maintenance needs on an aircraft. The option to defer maintenance is essential when there is no immediate flight risk to the aircraft. The different terms in a deferral can include MEL (Minimum Equipment List), MMEL (Master Minimum Equipment List), and NEF (Non-Essential Furnishings). These terms help defer maintenance on an aircraft that has damage not affecting flight safety; in other words, the aircraft can still fly with an MMEL, MEL, or NEF tag.

The article "On Error Management: Lessons from Aviation" explores how human errors can be better understood in relation to aviation accidents. With an understanding of human error, there is a better chance to mitigate risks. The article emphasizes the need to prevent human errors through open communication, continuous training, and learning from past mistakes. The implementation of these practices can significantly improve safety in aviation.
